<h3>Subject: Sinkholes, Songbirds, and a TV Invasion</h3>

<h4>Transit & City Life</h4>
<p><b>Sinkhole season, apparently.</b> <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/sinkhole-center-city-prompts-septa-detours-commuter-frustration">Center City commuters ran into a new sinkhole</a> that shut down part of 15th St. and forced a bunch of SEPTA reroutes. If you rely on the 2, 17, or any bus through Rittenhouse: expect detours until the city patches things up.</p>
<p><b>Swing bridge, almost ready.</b> If you bike or jog the Schuylkill River Trail: the long-awaited <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/swing-bridge-schuylkill-river-trail-bartrams-garden-grays-ferry-crescent-park/">swing bridge in South Philly is close to opening</a>. Pretty soon, you’ll finally have a direct connection between Bartram’s Garden and Grays Ferry Crescent Park (i.e., less asphalt, more river views).</p>
<p><b>Chubby Chicks is out.</b> Center City’s brunch spot <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/chubby-chicks-philadelphia-closing-harassment/">Chubby Chicks is shutting down after ongoing drama with neighbors</a>, harassment allegations, and a drawn-out public spat. If you need a new eggs benny fix, PhillyMag's <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/things-to-do/2025/07/29/best-of-philly-2025-date-night-ideas/">Best of Philly date night list</a> has options (some even brunchy).</p>

<h4>Streets & Safety</h4>
<p><b>Serious heat sticks around.</b> <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/philadelphia-weather-heat-advisory-continues-tuesday-possible-record-breaking-temps">Heat advisories are in effect through at least Wednesday</a>. City pools are crowded, trash pickup is slow, and public works crews are moving gingerly. Conserve water if you can.</p>
<p><b>Carjackings & follow-homes:</b> Multiple reports yesterday. <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/woman-carjacked-while-waiting-pump-philadelphia-gas-station-police">A woman was carjacked while waiting at a West Philly gas pump</a>, and in New Jersey, <a href="https://phl17.com/phl17-news/crime/nj-couple-followed-from-philadelphia-to-home-suspects-steal-rolex-and-wallet/">a couple was followed from the city, robbed at home</a>. Just keep your head on a swivel coming from night out.</p>
<p><b>New faces on TV:</b> NBC10 <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2025/07/29/kelsey-kushner-nbc10-philadelphia/">hired Kelsey Kushner</a> to the anchor desk. More news, less cheesesteaks? We’ll see.</p>

<h4>Civic Stuff</h4>
<p><b>Five-year plan, approved.</b> The state <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/state-board-unanimously-approves-philly-mayors-five-year-plan/4244425/">signed off on Philly’s budget blueprint</a>, meaning more funding certainty for schools, rec, and cleaning crews. Don’t expect tax cuts, but do expect a little less chaos come budget season next year.</p>
<p><b>SEPTA layoffs dodged (for now):</b> Federal funds are still iffy, but <a href="https://whyy.org/npr_story_post/philadelphia-summer-learning-federal-funding-schools/">summer learning programs for kids are sticking around</a> thanks to creative city/partner funding. No word yet on Youth Passes for transit, though.</p>

<h4>Eat/Drink/See/Do</h4>
<p><b>Date night inspiration:</b> <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/things-to-do/2025/07/29/best-of-philly-2025-date-night-ideas/">Philly Mag’s Best Of list</a> is out, with 10 picks to actually surprise a date (think candle-making, tiki dens, rooftop cinema, etc.).</p>
<p><b>Tavern on Camac’s glow-up:</b> <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2025/07/29/tavern-on-camac-gay-bar-reopens/">America’s oldest gay piano bar just finished a major renovation</a>. New look, same singalongs—worth a stop in Midtown Village.</p>
<p><b>'Abbott Elementary' goes meta:</b> Quinta Brunson says the new season will <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/abbott-elementary-filming-philly-fifth-season-live-event/">actually film a live event in Philly</a>. TV crews inbound soon; expect local cameos and street closure notices.</p>
<p><b>'Love is Blind' casting here:</b> Netflix is coming for Philly singles. <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/netflix-love-is-blind-casting-philadelphia-singles/">Time to see who’s really here for the right reasons</a>.</p>

<h4>Sports, Quick Hits</h4>
<p><b>Phillies are busy, maybe too busy.</b> They’re <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/report-phillies-among-teams-annoying-twins-trade-calls-mlb-deadline-jhoan-duran-harrison-bader/">"annoying" the Twins with trade calls</a>—bullpen arms are a focus. Also reportedly in the mix for <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/phillies-news-analysis-mlb-trade-rumors-deadline-date-time-ryan-helsley-stats-highlights-cardinals-bullpen-relief-pitchers/">Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley</a>. Deadline is coming fast.</p>
<p><b>RIP Ryne Sandberg.</b> The <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/ryne-sandberg-former-phillies-player-and-manger-dies-chicago-cubs-wrigley-field-hall-of-fame/">former Phillies player and Cubs Hall of Famer</a> died at 65. The scene at CBP next home game will be somber.</p>
<p><b>Eagles training camp:</b> It’s early, the offense is <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-2025-training-camp-practice-notes-day-5-sloppy-offense-good-defense/">sloppy, but the defense looks tough</a>. Fangio’s challenging Adoree’ Jackson, and <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-2025-training-camp-battle-tracker-cornerback-safety-linebacker-right-guard-rb2/">battle tracker</a> is heating up. Optimism, but as always in July: measured.</p>
<p>Stay cool if you can. We’ll be back tomorrow with more. –YIP</p>    <!-- Newsletter CTA -->
