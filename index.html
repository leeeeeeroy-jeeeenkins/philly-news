<p>Hey Philly, here’s what you actually missed yesterday:</p>

<h3>City Hall & Neighborhood Moves</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/philadelphia-business-curfew-kensington-germantown-fairhill-city-council/">City Council is sticking by the business curfew</a> that started in Kensington and is now rolling out to Germantown and Fairhill. The plan: 24-hour spots (except pharmacies and gas) will have to shut down from midnight to 6 a.m. Council insists it’s about curbing crime, but plenty of folks aren’t thrilled about losing their late-night bodegas to policy instead of competition.</p>
<p>On the classroom front, <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/philadelphia-board-ed-approves-new-contract-teachers-union">the Board of Ed approved a new teachers’ union contract</a>—details are still slim, but it’s a move toward more stability ahead of the year.</p>
<p>And for those in Port Richmond: <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/richmond-library-reopening-september-2025-renovation/">the Richmond Library finally reopened</a> after a long $2.5M reno. Grab your library card and go see some new carpet.</p>
