<p><strong>Weather check</strong>: Winter showed up early — a wintry mix hit parts of Philly and the burbs yesterday, and while Center City mostly saw rain, schools in the outer ‘burbs delayed opening. <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/winter-weather-wintry-mix-will-change-rain-philadelphia-snow-expected-suburbs">PennDOT was out salting</a> and Lehigh Valley got a real taste of snow. More next week, so don’t retire that ice scraper.</p>

<h3>City Stuff</h3>
<p><strong>Council moves</strong>: Philly City Council just advanced <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/parker-housing-plan-council-advances-budget/">the $277M budget</a> for Mayor Parker's new signature housing plan. It’s aiming to help more folks become homeowners, with a heavy focus on first-time buyers and those at risk of displacement. Also, there’s a push to <a href="https://6abc.com/post/councilmember-pushes-easier-outdoor-dining-permits-philadelphia/18241913/">make outdoor dining permits easier</a> for restaurants, so you can expect more streeteries (and heated tents) this winter.
</p>
<p><strong>Philly makes headlines (again)</strong>: Sorry, not for fine dining. <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2025/12/02/top-dining-destination-cheesesteaks/">Philly was just named America’s top dining destination… supposedly because of cheesesteaks</a>. (Sigh.) Look, the hoagie discourse rolls on forever, but we all know this city’s food game is more than just red sauce and provolone.</p>

<h3>Transit & Getting Around</h3>
<p><strong>SEPTA update</strong>: Trying to make your train on time? SEPTA is <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/septa-borrowing-train-cars-from-maryland-marc/4310283/">borrowing rail cars from Maryland</a> this week to help with overcrowding while their own fleet is in rough shape. Don’t expect miracles, but maybe your commute will be a little less sardine-can-like.
</p>
<p><strong>Amazon: Prime, but faster</strong>. Philly is <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2025/12/02/amazon-delivery-philadelphia-30-minutes/">getting 30-minute Amazon delivery</a>. Wild. Don’t ask how your old neighbors in Fishtown will react to even more branded vans, though.</p>

<h3>Sports Drama</h3>
<p><strong>Eagles saga continues</strong>: The <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-power-ranking-roundup-week-14-2025/">power rankings</a> aren’t kind, and the NFL kicked the Eagles-Commanders game out of prime time. Meanwhile, <a href="https://phl17.com/phl17-news/eagles-coordinator-kevin-patullos-home-vandalized-after-loss-to-bears/">offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo’s house was egged</a> after Sunday’s bust. Nick Sirianni put the blame squarely on himself (<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/nick-sirianni-blames-eagles-struggles-on-self-aj-brown-offense-week-14/4309860/">for real</a>), and Patullo isn’t losing his job just yet, so let’s see if that calms things.
</p>
<p><strong>Flyers lose more than just a game</strong>: After a loss to the Penguins, the <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/flyers-injury-update-tyson-foerster-timeline-upper-body-right-arm-slapshot-nhl/">Flyers are now down Tyson Foerster</a> for 2–3 months with an injury.
</p>

<h3>Quick Hits</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>RIP Officer Andy Chan</strong>: The Philly officer critically hurt in a 2018 motorcycle crash <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/philadelphia-police-officer-andy-chan-dies-six-years-after-crash/4310085/">passed away yesterday</a>. City flags will be lowered — a tough loss for PPD.</li>
  <li><strong>Quinta Brunson is giving back</strong>: The <em>Abbott Elementary</em> star started a <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/quinta-brunson-philadelphia-schools-abbott-elementary-field-trips/">new fund for Philly public school kids</a> to go on field trips. Love to see it.</li>
  <li><strong>Gas prices alert</strong>: Fill up—<a href="https://6abc.com/post/gas-prices-hit-4-year-low-average-falls-below-3-gallon/18241779/">average gas is now below $3/gallon</a> in the region for the first time since 2020. (Yes, really.)</li>
  <li><strong>New cruise ship terminal coming</strong>: Construction just started on a <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/new-cruise-terminal-philly-norwegian-cruise-line/">new Philly cruise terminal near the airport</a>. Ready for those Norwegian sailings next spring?</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s the Philly you missed yesterday. Stay warm, keep an eye on those clouds, and don’t let anyone tell you all we eat is cheesesteaks.</p>    <!-- Newsletter CTA -->
