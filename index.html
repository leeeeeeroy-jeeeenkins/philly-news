<p>Hey Philly — here’s what you missed while emptying shelves of milk, bread, and apparently cat food. The city is bracing for a real-deal snowstorm, public schools are contemplating some major changes, and there’s a lot happening on the food and sports front. Let’s get to it.</p>

<h3>SNOW WATCH: The Great Grocery Grab</h3>
<p>The big story: <a href="https://6abc.com/post/winter-storm-2026-what-know-snow-emergency-routes-philadelphia/18450490/">Philadelphia is bracing for a serious winter storm this weekend</a> (think plows, emergency parking rules, and up to a foot of snow depending who you believe). Shoppers have already ransacked stores for staples and then some — <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/philadelphia-snowstorm-grocery-shopping-milk-eggs-cat-food/">cat food is apparently the new toilet paper</a>. Salt is in short supply, so early birds got the good stuff. Crews around the region are prepping plows and routes; if you need to review <em>exactly</em> which snow emergency routes mess with your parking, <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/what-winter-weather-state-emergency-means-philadelphia-delaware-new-jersey">here’s what an emergency declaration actually means</a> for Philly.</p>

<h3>EDUCATION: School Shake-Up Incoming?</h3>
<p>In non-weather news: the School District just dropped a <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/with-2-8b-plan-philly-school-district-calls-to-close-or-repurpose-20-schools/4337404/">$2.8 billion plan that’d close or repurpose 20 public schools</a> — likely one near you. Officials swear it’s about fixing up old buildings and "enhancing educational opportunities," but expect plenty of neighborhood pushback. The actual list of schools is coming soon. 
</p>

<h3>GOVERNMENT: Housing $$$ and Trash Drama</h3>
<p>City Council approved <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-city-council-housing-plan-800-million/">$800 million for housing programs</a>, shifting more aid to the lowest-income residents. Meanwhile, a controversial bill to <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/trash-incineration-bill-vote-postponed-chester/">ban Philly from burning trash</a> was put on hold before a vote — so for now, the city’s waste keeps heading to Chester.</p>

<h3>AROUND TOWN: Villanova Threat, Pet Expo, More</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Villanova shut down Thursday</b> after a threat against an academic building (<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/villanova-university-closed-thursday-due-to-threat-of-violence/4337250/">all clear by afternoon</a>; campus safe).</li>
<li><b>Foodies, take a bow:</b> Philly snagged <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/philadelphia-nominations-james-beard-award-semifinalists/">13 James Beard Award semifinalist nods</a>, and <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/greg-vernick-new-italian-restaurant-emilia-east-kensington/">Greg Vernick’s new spot</a> opens in Kensington soon.</li>
<li><b>ReAnimator Coffee</b> is bringing its sixth location to Mount Airy. Bad news for your New Year’s resolution.</li>
<li>Need plans? <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/free-winter-jawn-alt-1045-philadelphia-2026/">Free Winter Jawn concert</a> this weekend (if you can dig out), and <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/greater-philly-pet-expo-dogs-cats-alpacas-adoptions-oaks/">Greater Philly Pet Expo</a> returns to Oaks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>SPORTS DESK: Offseason Shuffle & Flyers Pain</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Mythical snow aside, the most consistent thing in town is chaos in the Eagles’ front office:</b> they’re <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-coaching-search-rumor-and-report-tracker-nick-sirianni-kevin-patullo-offensive-coordinator/">still hunting for a new offensive coordinator</a>, with <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/declan-doyle-offensive-coordinator-search-eagles-interview-bears-ben-johnson/4337310/">Bears OC Declan Doyle interviewed</a>. Also, Christian Parker is reportedly leaving for Dallas (yep, the Cowboys). </li>
<li><b>Phillies</b> still want to move Nick Castellanos; Harrison Bader rumors swirling.</li>
<li><b>Flyers</b> surrendered a win in classic Flyers fashion (<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nhl/philadelphia-flyers/flyers-suffer-overtime-loss-mammoth-demoralizing-fashion/4337000/">demoralizing OT loss</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>ICYMI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Philly is suing the federal government over the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/slavery-exhibit-removed-independence-mall-philadelphia-thursday/4337781/">removal of the slavery exhibit at Independence Mall</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/south-street-banners-artists-design-lampposts-application/">South Street needs local artists</a> for new lamppost banners.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bunker down, charge your devices, and don’t forget to move your car off snow routes. Stay warm, Philly.</p>    <!-- Newsletter CTA -->
