<!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) --><h2>Yesterday in Philly: Teachers On Edge, Murals Everywhere, Eagles On the Clock</h2>

<p><strong>Back-to-school drama, new art on the walls, and the Birds finding out who actually wants to tackle this year.</strong></p>

<h3>🚸 Schools &amp; Teachers: Strike Watch (Again)</h3>
<p>Yes, it’s that time of year: <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/philadelphia-teachers-union-strike-contract-negotiations-school-year/">Philly teachers could actually strike</a> if the district and union don’t finally agree on a new contract. The current one’s up at the end of August and negotiations are, uh, tense. Meanwhile, some good news: <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/back-to-school-freebies-discounts-for-teachers-and-students-in-philadelphia/4247589/">freebies and discounts for teachers and students</a> are stacking up around the city. If you’re prepping your supplies, check the list.</p>

<h3>🏈 Eagles: Training Camp Battles &amp; Big Needs</h3>
<p>Football’s back, training camp drama is hot, and the Eagles have some real questions. Curious who’s fighting for a job? <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-2025-training-camp-battle-tracker-cornerback-safety-linebacker-right-guard-rb2/">PhillyVoice has a full battle tracker</a> (yes, RB2 is still a thing).

<p>Over on the nostalgia front, <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/eric-allen-enshrined-in-pro-football-hall-of-fame-kelly-green-canton-ohio/4248033/">Eric Allen was finally enshrined in the Hall of Fame</a>, getting real about those Kelly Greens. Well deserved.</p>

<h3>⚾ Phillies: Duran’s Debut, Bats Go Quiet</h3>
<p>Reliever Jhoan Duran made a whole scene with his blazing debut and lit up the park, but the <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/phillies-news-analysis-stats-highlights-score-jhoan-duran-entrance-cbp-ranger-suarez-harrison-bader-bryce-harper-ejection/">Phils couldn’t pull off the comeback vs. Detroit</a>. Skubal outdueled Wheeler, and Harper got tossed. Next game’s another shot.</p>

<h3>🏙️ City Moves: Murals, Protests &amp; Rec Center Update</h3>
<p>Two new murals dropped: South Philly now has a massive <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/south-philadelphia-phillies-dick-allen-mural/">Dick Allen tribute</a> and <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/new-mural-unveiled-south-philly-honors-abolitionist-william-still-his-family">a fresh mural honoring abolitionist William Still and his family</a>. Take a walk and check them out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-presidents-house-site-slavery-exhibit-protest-trump-removal/">activists rallied at Independence Park</a> to protest attempts to remove the Presidents House slavery exhibit—another round in the fight over how Philly tells its history.</p>
<p>Out West, <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-police-arrest-alleged-gunman-recreation-center-shooting/">police arrested a suspect in that mass shooting at the Christy Rec Center</a> (and yes, the center just reopened). The city’s still reeling, but parents and kids are showing up anyway.</p>

<h3>🌍 Climate &amp; Water: Jersey Shore, Delaware River, Three Mile Island</h3>
<p>Activists say they’ll go all in to <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/delaware-river-basin-fracking-ban-activists-trump-administration-resistance/">fight any federal effort to lift the fracking ban in the Delaware River Basin</a>—that’s your drinking water, folks. </p>
<p>If you’re down the Shore, coastal towns are <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/new-jersey-oyster-shells-sea-level-rise-coastal-erosion-climate-change/">using recycled oyster shells for climate defense</a>. Bonus: actual oysters fighting sea level rise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/three-mile-island-restart-residents-concerns-federal-hearing-safety/">Three Mile Island wants to restart</a>, and locals aren’t thrilled—federal hearings and a lot of pointed questions about safety upgrades.</p>
