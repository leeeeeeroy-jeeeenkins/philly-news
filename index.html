<p><strong>Here’s what you actually missed in Philly yesterday.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Eagles, Eulogized</strong></h3>
<p>If you somehow avoided the collective city groan, yes, the <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-49ers-playoff-lose-changes-front-office-nfl-nick-sirianni/">Eagles lost to the 49ers</a> and their season is done. It was rough. Like, "how did you even make the playoffs if you were going to melt down like this?" rough. <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-thoughts-wild-card-loss-reactions-nick-sirianni-kevin-pautllo-offense-issues-new-coordinator/">No amount of sideline yelling could resurrect the offense</a>, so now everyone's talking about Sirianni's job, A.J. Brown's mood, and an <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-offseason-do-list-free-agency-draft-lane-johnson-aj-brown-nfl-nick-sirianni-kevin-patullo/">offseason to-do list</a> that feels about a mile long. Buckle up for a wild few months of rumors and hot takes.</p>

<h3><strong>Philly Health Watch</strong></h3>
<p>Big heads up: The <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/measles-exposure-possible-philadelphia-airport-train-station/">city is on alert for possible measles exposure</a> at the airport and 30th Street Station after a traveler passed through last week while infected. If you were at either place on Jan. 9-10 (or rode Amtrak to NYC), check your vaccine status and watch for symptoms. Local health officials are working on tracing exposures, but don’t ignore a weird rash right now.</p>

<h3><strong>Transit: Some Actual Good News</strong></h3>
<p>For once, some reliable service news from SEPTA: The <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/septa-trolley-tunnel-open-wire-repairs/">trolley tunnel to Center City is back open</a> after emergency repairs and morning express Regional Rail trains have resumed. If trolleys or the R5/R7/R8 are part of your day, things should be slightly less aggravating. For drivers, heads up: the massive <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/girard-point-bridge">Girard Point Bridge rehab project</a> starts now and runs five years. Rethink your Schuylkill shortcuts.</p>

<h3><strong>Neighborhood Notes</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2026/01/12/eataly-king-of-prussia-review/">new Eataly at King of Prussia is here</a>, and yes, it’s chaos (but the good kind). Worth a field trip if you’re craving pasta or confusion at the cheese counter.</li>
  <li>If you’re a Drexel or Powelton resident: Wawa’s all-digital, cashierless store is closing Jan. 21. Apparently, no one was ready for a hoagie vending machine.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/mummers-string-band-2026-lincoln-financial-field/">Mummers String Band competition</a> is now Jan. 31 at the Linc after getting rained out on New Year’s Day.</li>
  <li>Benjamin Franklin’s birthday is this Saturday, and the Franklin Institute is throwing him an appropriately nerdy bash. If Ben were here, he’d probably want you to show up and eat cake.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Quick Hits</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/game-ball-three-stars-and-snap-count-analysis-wild-card-round-eagles-vs-49ers/">Eagles fans are still rehashing every snap</a> (but really, just move on).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/sixers-vs-raptors-injury-report-news-joel-embiid-analysis-paul-george-kelly-oubre-jr/">Sixers dropped a bad one to Toronto</a>; Joel Embiid and Paul George were out. Trade rumors swirl anyway.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/philadelphia-weather-midweek-storm-could-bring-snow-rain-parts-area">midweek snow/rain mix</a> could mess up the commute. Check your apps in the morning.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it for yesterday. Back tomorrow with whatever else Philly throws at us.</p>    <!-- Newsletter CTA -->
