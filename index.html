<h3>Market East Skepticism, SNAP Benefits on Edge, and Hotel Workers Hit the Picket Line</h3>

<p><strong>Market East Is Back (Or Not?):</strong><br>
Mayor Parker says she’s ready for input on <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/philadelphia-market-east-redevelopment-plan-parker-76ers-comcast/">Market East’s next big plan</a>, but folks who lived through the Sixers arena drama are side-eyeing the whole thing. Many longtime residents worry “public input” means the same as last time, i.e., handed a done deal. Whether Comcast, the Sixers, or City Hall get their way, plenty of neighbors want an actual say. <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/philadelphia-leaders-look-revitalize-market-street-east">Here’s another look at what’s (maybe) next for Market East</a> — no shovels just yet.</p>

<p><strong>SNAP Uncertainty (Again):</strong><br>
If you rely on SNAP (food stamps), don’t make any big grocery runs. The <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/supreme-court-emergency-order-block-snap-payments/">Supreme Court’s emergency order</a> has put full payments in limbo for PA and NJ. The back-and-forth could impact thousands locally, and advocates are scrambling. <a href="https://6abc.com/post/governor-josh-shapiro-announces-snap-payments-resume-pennsylvania/18127319/">Gov. Shapiro says things may normalize</a> but, honestly, the situation is anything but clear. It’s not just families feeling it: <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/snap-families-feeding-pets/">Even their pets are getting caught in the mess</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Center City Wyndham Strike:</strong><br>
If you have friends or family staying in the city or work in hospitality, heads up: <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/wyndham-hotel-workers-strike-contract-negotiations/">Wyndham Hotel workers in Center City</a> walked out yesterday, demanding better pay and workloads. It’s not a one-day thing either. Travelers might notice changes, and it’s another sign of Philly’s workers turning up the pressure for better deals.</p>

<p><strong>Eagles & Phillies Updates:</strong><br>
For Birds fans watching that Week 10 injury report like it’s the weather, the skinny: <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-packers-week-10-injury-report-analysis-aj-brown-tucker-kraft-saquon-barkley-jayden-reed/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">A.J. Brown and a few other starters are questionable</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/eagles-injury-update-cam-jurgens-adoree-jackson-aj-brown-nolan-smith-packers/4299390/">Cam Jurgens is officially out against the Packers</a>. Don’t expect miracles, but the team still has options.<br>
Phillies off-season watch: Outfield depth is a <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/mlb-free-agency-phillies-rumors-outfield-harrison-bader-contract-news-kyle-tucker-cody-bellinger/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">big burning question</a>, and fans are keeping an eye on possible free-agent pickups.
