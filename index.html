<p>Welcome to <em>Yesterday in Philly</em>. Here’s what happened while you were out dodging puddles and SEPTA woes. (Or maybe just living your life. Good for you.)</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom:2px;">City Life + Infrastructure</h3>
<p><strong>Center City is getting some breathing room:</strong> <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/rittenhouse-open-streets-dates-2025-center-city/">Open Streets returns to Rittenhouse this fall</a>, shutting down Walnut from 8th to 22nd on six Sundays in September and October. Expect plenty of joggers, bikes, strollers, and folks looking for photo ops. If you’ve got plans near Rittenhouse on those dates, plan ahead—or just walk, for once.</p>

<p><strong>SEPTA can’t catch a break:</strong> The feds have kicked off an inquiry into how SEPTA is storing its retired electric buses (<a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/septa-faces-federal-inquiry-over-storage-decommissioned-electric-buses">story</a>), because if something can be a mess, Philly transit will find a way.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom:2px;">Closings, Openings, and Philly Flavor</h3>
<p><strong>End of an era:</strong> <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2025/08/07/giordanos-closing/">Giordano’s in the Italian Market is officially calling it quits</a>. After generations, the owner is saying goodbye, citing “the right time to retire.” Stop by for a last stash of produce and to say thanks for all the memories (and baskets of peppers).</p>

<p><strong>Looking for something new?</strong> <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/amada-philadelphia-redesign-jose-garces/">Amada in Old City just reopened</a> with a slick new design after a month-long renovation. If Spanish tapas are your thing, Jose Garces wants you back.</p>

<p><strong>Best of Philly Soirée eats were revealed</strong>—here’s where (and what) to expect to snack on if you scored tickets: <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2025/08/07/2025-best-of-philly-soiree-restaurants/">Food preview here</a>. No word on how many bites is too many.</p>

<p><strong>In sports bars news</strong>, Watch Party PHL just raised nearly $90,000 to help open what might be Philly’s first proper <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/watch-party-phl-bar-womens-sports-philadelphia/">women's sports bar</a>. Keep an eye out for the opening date.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom:2px;">Transit & Getting Around</h3>
<p><strong>Flights to Europe just got a little easier:</strong> American Airlines is adding nonstop service from PHL to Budapest and Prague (<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/american-airlines-philly-airport-budapest-prague/4250639/">details</a>). If you need an excuse for a fall getaway, this is it.</p>

<p><strong>Running over the Ben Franklin Bridge returns November 2</strong>. Register if you want bragging rights (and a few thousand steps to justify all that cheesesteak).</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom:2px;">Public Safety & Important Local News</h3>
