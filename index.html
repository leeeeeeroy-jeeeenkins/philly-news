<p>Hope you weren’t planning to ride SEPTA stress-free next week. The latest is here, along with new police contracts, Chinatown project setbacks, and a few reasons to leave the house. Here’s what Philly just pulled off while you were out living your life.</p>

<h3>SEPTA: The Struggle Continues</h3>
<p><a href="https://phillyvoice.com/septa-service-cuts-fare-increase-state-funding-deadline/">Lawmakers blew the deadline</a> to hammer out state funding for SEPTA, and now the agency is moving ahead with <strong>service cuts and fare hikes starting Aug. 24</strong>. If you ride Regional Rail, Bus, Trolley, or the El, expect less frequent service and pricier fares. <a href="https://6abc.com/post/septa-urges-riders-start-planning-now-upcoming-service-cuts-philadelphia-region-begin-aug-24/17547419/">SEPTA is warning everyone to plan ahead</a>—so maybe start mapping your Plan B now. And if you’ve got SEPTA-dependent kids headed back to school, parents in West Philly are <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/back-to-school-party-west-philly-parents-express-concern-ahead-septa-service-cuts">already organizing</a>. 
</p>

<h3>City Hall: Police Get a Boost</h3>
<p>While SEPTA is pinching pennies, <a href="https://phillyvoice.com/philly-police-contract-fop-lodge-5-civilian-jobs-cherelle-parker/">Philly police got a new contract</a> worth <strong>raises, bonuses, and extra benefits</strong> over the next two years. There’s also a new process to let civilians handle some department jobs—meant to free up more officers for the street. Mayor Parker called it a win for both cops and the city, but <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/city-awards-philly-police-new-wages-bonus-more-benefits-over-next-2-years/4254979/">there’s a price tag attached</a> for the city budget.
</p>

<h3>Chinatown Stitch Stalls Out</h3>
<p>Remember the plans to reconnect Chinatown across the Vine Street Expressway? The <a href="https://6abc.com/post/philadelphias-chinatown-stitch-project-looking-forward-losing-150m-federal-funds/17549451/">Chinatown Stitch project just lost $150 million</a> in federal money. Organizers say it’s not dead, but they’ll need to hunt for new funding—don’t expect bulldozers soon.
