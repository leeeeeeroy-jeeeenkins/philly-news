<h3>Subject: Baby Formula Recall & Sixers Stumble</h3>

<p><strong>Hey Philly, here’s what mattered yesterday:</strong></p>

<h4>🏀 Sixers Slip, Eagles Health Check</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/sixers-vs-pistons-box-score-highlights-stats-tyrese-maxey-vj-edgecombe-kelly-oubre-jr-dominick-barlow-andre-drummond/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">Sixers lost a very winnable NBA Cup game to the Pistons</a>, blowing a late lead against a half-strength squad and looking lost offensively down the stretch. Patience is wearing thin, especially with Maxey struggling to pull them out of the mess. Not a great sign as the season grinds on.</p>
<p>On the football front, <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-lions-week-11-injury-report-analysis-2025-lane-johnson-penei-sewell-aidan-hutchinson/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">Eagles’ Week 11 injury report is out</a>. Lane Johnson and a few key guys are banged up; more analysis in the link, but crossing fingers – Detroit is lurking and things are tight at the top.</p>

<h4>🚨 Safety Alerts: Formula Recall & Crime Updates</h4>
