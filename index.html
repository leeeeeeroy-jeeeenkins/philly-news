<p><strong>Traffic tickets, graveyard insanity, ICE protests, and playoff football — here's what you missed in Philly.</strong></p>

<h3>Getting Around: Watch the Red Lights</h3>
<p>If you still cruise through Eakins Oval by the Art Museum without stopping, start looking for $100 in your glove box — <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/red-light-cameras-philly-art-museum-eakins-oval/">red light cameras there just started ticketing for real</a>. No more warnings, just actual fines going out, so don't get caught being that person.</p>

<h3>Civic Stuff: Philly v. ICE</h3>
<p>In the wake of ICE's fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis, <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/minneapolis-killing-renee-good-ice-protest-philly/">protests hit Philly yesterday</a> and city officials told ICE to basically get lost. Hundreds rallied, especially in Center City, emphasizing Philly’s status as a so-called "sanctuary city." <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/philadelphia-protests-minneapolis-woman-killed-ice-agent/4329690/">More local coverage here</a>.</p>

<h3>True Crime, Weird Edition</h3>
<p>Big story: A Delco man allegedly <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/alleged-grave-robber/">stole more than 100 human skeletons from Mount Moriah Cemetery</a> — the remains were found in his home. Neighbors are all kinds of freaked out. If you need more gory details (or are checking on your ancestors), full rundown <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/human-remains-mount-moriah-cemetery-theft/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Eagles: Weather and Hype</h3>
<p>If you’re tailgating for Eagles-49ers this weekend, bring an umbrella for the dip into late Friday and Saturday — but <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/philadelphia-weather-rainy-start-weekend-will-clear-time-eagles-playoff-game">it’s supposed to clear for game time</a>. The city is fired up (rally busses, pep rallies) and <a href="https://6abc.com/post/philadelphia-eagles-get-fans-pumped-playoff-game-san-francisco-49ers-victory-bus-tour-pep-rally/18373267/">every South Philly rowhome has at least two flags up</a>. Game preview with the X’s and O’s is <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-49ers-preview-five-things-watch-when-eagles-have-ball-jalen-hurts-a-j-brown/">here</a> for the hardcores.</p>
