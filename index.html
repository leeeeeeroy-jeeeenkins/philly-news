<p>Alright Philly, here's what you missed — or what you'll have to dodge this weekend.</p>

<hr />

<h3>🚧 Street Closures & Festival Cancellations</h3>
<p>If you’re trying to drive anywhere near Old City, plan ahead: <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/market-street-closed-westbound-2nd-6th/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">Market Street is closing to westbound traffic between 2nd and 6th</a> for more than three months due to construction. So, yeah, expect more of that classic Philly gridlock if you’re heading into Center City. Find a new route now—or just surrender and take SEPTA.</p>
<p>In festival news, the <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/northern-liberties-night-market-canceled-costs-philadelphia-standard-tap/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">Northern Liberties Night Market</a> was officially canceled, thanks to rising costs and new city requirements that have made street festivals nearly impossible to throw. Locals aren’t thrilled, but it’s just another L for Philly’s neighborhood hangs (and for anyone who has strong opinions about birria tacos).</p>

<h3>🍕 Food Moves: Angelo’s Heads to Jersey, Jansen's 'Greatest Hits’</h3>
<p>Legendary <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/angelos-pizzeria-haddon-township-dinics-closing-south-philly-conshohocken/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">Angelo’s Pizzeria</a> just announced its first South Jersey outpost, taking over the old DiNic’s in Haddon Township. For pizza snobs, it might actually be worth crossing the bridge soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mt. Airy’s <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/jansen-mt-airy-closure-tasting-menu/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">Jansen</a> is going out with a bang before its September closure: they’re switching to a ‘greatest hits’ tasting menu, so if you want to pay your respects (and eat well), now’s your shot.</p>

<h3>🏟️ Sports: All-Star Game Heads Up, Phillies & Union</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/phillies-news-2026-mlb-all-star-game-logo-details-citizens-bank-park/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">Phillies</a> dropped the new 2026 MLB All-Star Game logo at City Hall. Looks slick, and it’s a reminder: Philly’s getting the midsummer classic for the nation’s 250th birthday—book those overpriced hotel rooms now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/philadelphia-union-win-streak-two-goals-tai-baribo-cavan-sullivan-supporters-shield-mls/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">Union</a> win streak is up to two as they chase the Supporters’ Shield, in case you prefer your sports with a little less heartbreak.</p>

<h3>🏠 Housing, College, and Federal Drama</h3>
<p>In Harrisburg, a <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/pennsylvania-flood-disclosure-bill-homeowner-awareness/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">Pa. bill was introduced to require full disclosure</a> of flood history in home sales. After another round of flooding this summer, it couldn’t come soon enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/tuition-increases-pennsylvania-universities-temple-trump-tax-law/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">Temple and other state schools</a> are raising tuition. If you’re thinking about college or have a kid headed that way—bad news, but sadly, not surprising.</p>
<p>On the federal stage, <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/trump-public-broadcasting-funding-cuts-pbs-npr-whyy-philadelphia/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">public broadcasters like NPR, PBS, and WHYY</a> are facing possible budget cuts after a House vote. If you love pledge drives, this is your moment to shine.</p>

<h3>📰 Other Stuff Worth Knowing</h3>
<ul>
<li>ICE drama in Norristown: <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2025/07/18/ice-raids-norristown/">Residents confronted agents</a>, calling them “2025 Nazis.” It got heated—watch this one, especially with the election news cycle spinning up.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/inaugural-north-philly-history-festival-concerts-panels-screenings/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">North Philly gets its first History Festival</a> this weekend. Expect panels, concerts, and real talk about the neighborhood’s culture and past.</li>
<li>Philly’s honoring <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/teddy-pendergrass-street-renaming-philadelphia/4236804/">Teddy Pendergrass</a> with a street renaming soon. It’s about time.</li>
<li>Eastern State Penitentiary has a new <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/eastern-state-penitentiary-rebrand-education-justice-philadelphia/4237195/">educational rebrand</a>—expect more focus on history, less on Halloween scares (but don’t worry, Terror Behind the Walls isn’t going anywhere just yet).</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Check your routes, savor your pizza, and keep an eye on City Hall. See you out there.</p>    <!-- Newsletter CTA -->
