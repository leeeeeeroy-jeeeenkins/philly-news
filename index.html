<p>Welcome to *Yesterday in Philly*, your city-in-a-blender recap for folks who want the quick version (because everyone's got stuff to do).</p>

<h3>🚌 SEPTA Situation: Here Come the Cuts</h3>
<p>If your commute involves a SEPTA bus, brace yourself: major service cuts started Sunday across the city. <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/riders-brace-for-impact-as-septa-service-cuts-set-to-begin-on-sunday/4258625/">Some lines are on pause or gone for now</a> (RIP, No. 12 bus), and frequency will be thinner almost everywhere. The move is about budget problems and ridership trends, but it’s putting parents on edge as their kids’ school commutes get flipped upside down. <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/parents-worry-commute-school-septa-cuts/4258750/">Parents are worried about safety and longer, more complicated routes</a>. SEPTA’s boosting police presence at stations and stops, but there were <a href="https://6abc.com/post/philadelphia-police-investigate-shooting-involving-route-3-septa-bus/17617133/">multiple police incidents this weekend</a>, so tensions are up.</p>
<p>Full details, a list of affected routes, and how to adjust are here: <a href="https://6abc.com/post/commuter-crisis-first-round-septa-cuts-go-effect-sunday-due-lack-funding-what-need-know/17596775/">6ABC: What you need to know about the SEPTA cuts</a>.

<h3>⚾ Phillies Hit, Phillies Hurt</h3>

<p>On the brighter side, <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/jt-realmuto-scorching-hot-giving-phils-long-awaited-cleanup-hitter-mlb-bryce-harper-kyle-schwarber-analysis/">J.T. Realmuto is smashing at the plate</a>, finally giving the team that reliable cleanup power they’ve been missing. Only problem: can the bats keep making up for what’s missing on the mound?</p>
