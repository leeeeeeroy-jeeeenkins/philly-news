<p>Hey Philly, here’s what happened yesterday when you weren’t looking:</p>

<h3>City Life & Closures</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>RIP Frank Olivieri Sr.</strong> – The longtime owner of <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/frank-olivieri-sr-death-pats-steaks-south-philly/">Pat’s King of Steaks</a> died at 87, leaving a serious hole in the city’s cheesesteak lore. Even if you’re more of a Geno’s person, this one stings. Related: Steak dinner just hits different when we’re saying goodbye.</li>
  <li>In Kensington: <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/cantina-la-martina-la-tamalada-kensington-philadelphia/">Cantina la Martina</a> is back in action with its first Philly event since closing: a community tamalada this Thursday. It’s a win for local food in a neighborhood that needs it.</li>
  <li>Schools started late (or not at all) Tuesday thanks to bitter cold and icy roads. That also means possible delays for the rest of the week. Oh, and there’s <a href="https://www.fox29.com/weather/substantial-snowfall-could-hit-philadelphia-area-weekend-nws">talk of real snow</a> coming this weekend.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Housing & Development</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The huge, crumbling Brith Sholom House in West Philly secured <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/brith-sholom-house-renovation/">$50M in public/private money</a> for a "gut rehab"—meaning 360 affordable homes for seniors finally getting proper repairs. Not a bad start for Mayor Parker’s promises on housing.</li>
  <li>Also: <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/phillys-largest-union-funded-affordable-housing-project-launches-wynnefield-heights">Philly’s biggest union-funded affordable housing project</a> is moving forward in Wynnefield Heights. More homes, still a drop in the bucket, but better than nothing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transit & Roads</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Chester County commuters: The Turnpike’s <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/pa-turnpike-widen-chester-county/">five-year, $338M widening project</a> just kicked off. Get ready for detours, closures, and an endless parade of orange cones.</li>
  <li>Montgomery County folks: there’s a <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/montgomery-county-officials-announce-detours-closures-major-bridge-replacement-project">major bridge replacement</a> and new closure/detour plans you’ll want to check. Philly’s bad to drive in (<a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/pennsylvania-is-one-of-the-worst-states-to-drive-in-report">literally ranked one of the worst states</a>)… this is not helping.</li>
  <li><strong>Viral SEPTA moment:</strong> An <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/septa-bus-altercation-intern-pepper-spray/">altercation on a SEPTA bus</a> made the rounds after a former WHYY intern was pepper sprayed. No one seriously hurt, but insert “public transit in Philly” meme here.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Protests, Politics & Philly Drama</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Protesters <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/protesters-block-garage-ice-facility-center-city-philadelphia/4335972/">blocked the ICE garage in Center City</a> Tuesday, joining a national push for companies to cut ties with Israeli arms manufacturers. Traffic on the block was a mess.</li>
  <li>In NJ, Mikie Sherrill was <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/mikie-sherrill-new-jersey-governor-sworn/">sworn in as governor</a> and signed her first Executive Orders—including help for people facing crazy-high utility costs. Tips for Jersey e-bike riders: <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/new-jersey-ebike-law-license-registration-insurance-requirements/">new licensing/insurance rules just arrived</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sports & Culture</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Flyers <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/flyers-thoughts-losing-streak-snapped-travis-konecny-bobby-brink-penalties/">snapped their losing streak</a>, but good luck celebrating—now it’s a slog uphill in the standings.</li>
  <li>Sixers pulled out a win thanks to <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/sixers-pacers-highlights-box-score-stats-tyrese-maxey-vj-edgecombe-arguing-video-joel-embiid-nick-nurse-jared-mccain-nba/">Tyrese Maxey nabbing eight(!) steals</a> and some actually-watchable defense. But heads up: Joel Embiid’s out again for the next one.</li>
  <li>Finally, if you want to argue about which restaurant really is the best, <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2026/01/20/podcast-50-best-restaurants/">Philly Mag dropped their ‘50 Best Restaurants’</a> podcast and spill the tea on how they rank your favorites. Let the debates begin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stay warm out there—single digits are in the forecast.</p>
