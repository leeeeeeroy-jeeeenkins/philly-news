<p>Welcome to Friday. If you were too busy dodging rain or cursing at your Regional Rail app, here’s what went down in Philly yesterday.</p>

<h3>SEPTA: Lawsuits, Fares, and Train Woes</h3>
<p>Just when you thought SEPTA’s week couldn’t get any messier – <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2025/10/09/septa-fare-hikes-lawsuit/">George Bochetto filed a class-action lawsuit</a> arguing that SEPTA’s September fare hike was illegal. (See also: <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/septa-class-action-lawsuit-fare-increases/">more lawsuit details</a>.) If you ride Regional Rail, yesterday probably felt like Groundhog Day: an outage suspended all lines in the morning (<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/transportation-and-transit/septa-suspends-all-regional-rail-lines-due-to-signal-power-issues/4282675/">again</a>), but service mostly resumed by late afternoon. SEPTA’s older Silverliner IV trains are still under <a href="https://6abc.com/post/look-inside-septa-starliner-iv-inspections-following-ntsb-report/17973052/">inspection</a> after cracks were discovered, desperately trying to get enough cars back in rotation. Also, a <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/person-hit-by-amtrak-train-trenton-line-suspended">person was struck by a train on the Trenton Line</a>, so Amtrak and some SEPTA service were disrupted even more. In short: If you get where you’re going today, it’s a win.</p>

<h3>Phillies and Eagles: Stayin’ Alive (Sorta)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://whyy.org/episodes/the-phillies-have-a-heartbeat-after-winning-game-3/">Phillies aren’t dead yet</a>. Kyle Schwarber smashed two homers (<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-phillies-nlds-game-3/">game recap</a> | <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/schwarber-clubs-2-home-runs-keep-phillies-playoff-hopes-alive-los-angeles">Fox29</a>) and Ranger Suárez showed up, keeping the NLDS alive for at least one more day. But the margin is thin, and Game 4 is do or die (<a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/phillies-nlds-kyle-schwarber-ranger-suarez-keep-season-alive-game-4-preview-dodgers-mlb/">preview</a>). As for the Eagles: injuries are stacking up (<a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-giants-week-6-inactives-analysis-2025-jalen-carter-landon-dickerson-malik-nabers/">inactives report</a>), and the Giants have some new faces in the backfield (<a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/know-your-enemy-eagles-face-new-giants-run-game-qb-jaxson-dart-rb-cam-skattebo-vic-fagio-nfc-east/">know your enemy</a>). Betting folks, here’s <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-giants-staff-picks-betting-odds-money-lines-jalen-hurts-aj-brown-saquon-barkley-jaxson-dart-week-6-nfl-2025/">your odds and staff picks</a>.</p>

<h3>Navy Parade, Philly Events, and Local Moves</h3>
<p>If you saw huge ships and military flyovers on the Delaware River, that’s the <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/navy-warship-parade-philadelphia-delaware-river-250/">Navy’s 250th anniversary bash</a> kicking off (<a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/parade-ships-how-watch-navy-marine-corps-250th-celebration-delaware-river">how to catch the next celebration</a>). On the ground: Philly’s Free Library is <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/free-library-saturday-hours-seven-locations/">adding Saturday hours at seven more branches</a>—that’s a win for anyone whose schedule is, well, chaotic. The <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/philadelphia-flower-show-theme-2026/">2026 Flower Show</a> will focus on American gardening, so mark your calendars if that’s your thing.</p>

<h3>Food & Neighborhood Bites</h3>
<p>A few tasty highlights: <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2025/10/09/everybody-eats-cafe/">Everybody Eats Cafe</a> in Delco is getting a lot of love for going above and beyond as a Black-owned local spot. <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2025/10/09/best-food-to-eat-in-delco/">Delco’s classic foods</a> got their own shoutout (yes, there’s more than cheesesteaks out there). Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/philly-coffee-festival-returns-center-city-october/">Philly Coffee Festival</a> returns soon, so brace for more lines at La Colombe. Oh, and this October is <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/2025-dine-latino-restaurant-week-bring-authentic-eats-philly-october">Dine Latino Restaurant Week</a>—supporting actual local eats, not chains.</p>
