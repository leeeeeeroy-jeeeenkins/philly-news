<h3>Thousands Rally Downtown, Fewer Answers for Kada Scott</h3>
<p>Center City was packed Saturday as thousands showed up for the second day of <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-no-kings-anti-trump-rally-october/">‘No Kings’ protests</a> against Trump outside Independence Mall and all over the country. Expected: huge signs, speeches, plenty of energy. Some roads and parking were a mess — classic protest aftermath. Philly’s usual political divide was on full display, but the city stayed mostly peaceful. <a href="https://6abc.com/post/road-closures-parking-restrictions-2nd-no-kings-rally-philadelphia/18024842/">Here’s which roads were closed</a>, in case you’re planning your Sunday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the search for missing Philly woman <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/police-search-missing-philadelphia-woman-kada-scott/4287362/">Kada Scott</a> took a tragic turn. Human remains were found Saturday in North Philly, and though police haven’t confirmed the ID officially, family and multiple sources say it’s likely Scott. The search nears two weeks. There’s now a <a href="https://6abc.com/post/10000-reward-offered-search-missing-philadelphia-woman-kada-scott-nears-weeks/18024610/">$12,000 reward</a> for information. More perspective from family <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/kada-scott-family-speaks-out-amid-keon-kings-previous-bail-controversy">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Transit + Neighborhood News</h3>
<p>Another weekend, another SEPTA headline: a man was <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/deadly-shooting-septa-train-station-center-city-philadelphia-murder-charges/4287560/">shot and killed</a> at a busy Center City station, and a suspect’s already facing murder charges. The city’s still hashing out what safety on public transit should look like — but yeah, it’s tense.</p>
<p>In more positive city moves, the <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-land-bank-garden-lots-purchase-preservation/">Philly Land Bank</a> just bought 35 garden lots. This is not just a gardening nerd thing: Land preservation means more green space and fewer surprise developments next to your block. Win for neighborhoods.</p>

<h3>Sports: Returns, Rookies, and Future Draft Dreams</h3>
<p>The Sixers chopped down their preseason roster, waiving four players <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/sixers-news-analysis-roster-g-league-delaware-blue-coats-kennedy-chandler-marjon-beauchamp-malcolm-hill-saint-thomas/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">(details)</a>.
