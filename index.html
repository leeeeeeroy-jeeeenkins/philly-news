<p><strong>Sports (Because This City Never Sleeps)</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/chiefs-super-bowl-rematch-nfl-week-2-live-updates-score-highlights/4268301/">Eagles pulled off a tough 20-17 win over the Chiefs</a> at Arrowhead, avenging the Super Bowl and moving to a crisp 2-0 start. The defense did the heavy lifting—<a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-chiefs-score-highlights-andrew-mukuba-interception-devonta-smith-catch-tush-push/">rookie Andrew Mukuba grabbed the big interception, and the Birds kept Mahomes in check</a> (ugly win? Sure. Still counts.). Die-hards are already <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/mailbag-how-long-can-eagles-super-bowl-window-stay-open/">debating how long this Super Bowl window actually stays open</a>. If you want the nerdy details, here's <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-week-2-stock-watch-chiefs-jalen-hurts-zadarius-smith-jalen-carter-andrew-mukuba-defense-analysis-news/">who’s rising and falling in the Eagles’ stock watch</a>.</p>
<p>On the diamond, the <a href="https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/news/sports/mlb/philadelphia-phillies/clinch-playoff-berth-national-league-brewers-dodgers-mets-giants/4269133/">Phillies officially clinched their playoff berth</a>—that’s four seasons in a row—although they <a href="https://6abc.com/post/perezs-5-rbis-lead-royals-phillies-10-3-delay-nl-east-clinch/17816679/">couldn’t quite lock down the NL East yet after a loss to the Royals</a>. Still, with the division and first-round bye up for grabs, the next couple games actually matter. Fans are <a href="https://6abc.com/post/phillies-fans-excited-team-could-clinch-division/17815471/">already losing their minds</a> and/or looking for playoff tickets.
</p>
<p><strong>City Beats</strong></p>
<p>If you ride public transit, brace yourself. <a href="https://6abc.com/post/full-septa-service-resumes-fare-hikes/17815518/">SEPTA's running full service again—but your wallet’s getting hit</a>. Fares officially went up yesterday, right in time for everyone’s Monday return. Maybe check your balance before you tap on.</p>
<p>If you noticed more chatter about the President’s House exhibits: <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/slavery-exhibit-philadelphia-protest-trump-removal/">activists are rallying to keep the slavery history displays at Independence Mall</a> as a Trump administration deadline to remove them looms. Big implications for how Philly tells its own story—worth watching if you care about what history this city puts in front of visitors.
</p>
<p>Also in civic news: <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/post-office-renamed-temple-police-officer/4268999/">A North Philly post office now bears the name of the fallen Temple University police officer who was killed last year</a>. The dedication comes after a long push from his family and the community.
</p>
<p><strong>Quick Hits and Worth-Noting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://whyy.org/articles/mexican-independence-day-festival-2025/">Thousands hit Penn’s Landing for Mexican Independence Day</a>. If you stayed home, you missed world-class food and the biggest salsa dance circle of the year.</li>
<li>If you heard sirens in Kensington: <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/four-car-crash-kensington/4269050/">four-car crash sent nine to the hospital</a>, but everyone is expected to survive.</li>
<li>And Philly Museum of Art is showing off <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-art-museum-screenprinting-brand-x/">the best art screenprinting you’re gonna see all year</a>. Perfect for an indoor day.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the gist: Eagles flying high, Phillies’ fate hanging, SEPTA asking for more, history at stake in Old City, and the city being Philly as always. Catch you tomorrow.</p>    <!-- Newsletter CTA -->
