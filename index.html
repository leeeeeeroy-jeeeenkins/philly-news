<h3>Subject: Philly Workers Hold the Line, SEPTA Parking No Longer Free</h3>
<p>Good morning. Here’s what went down in the city yesterday—labor drama, some burning trash, double takes for Philly sports, and a heads-up so you don’t get hit with surprise parking fees today.</p>

<h4>Strike Watch</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/dc33-strike-philadelphia-day-6/">DC33 city workers strike</a> hit day six. No talks Sunday, so the trash will keep piling up for now—a couple of sites even caught fire from dumped garbage (<a href="https://6abc.com/post/dc-33-strike-firefighters-battle-flames-2-separate-trash-dumping-sites/16983993/">firefighters were busy</a>), and the union is setting up a strike fund and asking for <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/district-council-33-create-strike-fund-seeking-food-water-donations">food and water donations</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re annoyed by overflowing cans, you’re not alone. No end in sight until the city and union get back to the table.</p>

<h4>Heads Up: SEPTA Parking Fees Back</h4>
<p>Parking at SEPTA lots? The holiday is over—<a href="https://6abc.com/post/septa-parking-fees-go-effect-monday/16984787/">paid spots return</a> today (Monday). Expect to shell out the usual, or risk a ticket.</p>

<h4>Sports: All-Star Shocks (and Not the Good Kind)</h4>
<p>If you thought the Phillies’ killer first half meant a roster takeover at the All-Star Game, think again. <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/phillies-named-mlb-all-star-team-rosters-nl-kyle-schwarber-zack-wheeler/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">Only Zack Wheeler and Kyle Schwarber</a> made it, which has left plenty of people scratching their heads (<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/mlb/philadelphia-phillies/zack-wheeler-kyle-schwarber-2025-mlb-all-star/4227323/">more here</a>). Still, Wheeler nearly pitched a perfect game against the Reds, and the Phillies secured another series win—ho-hum, just another day for the best record in baseball (<a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/winners-losers-phillies-reds-zack-wheeler-ranger-suarez-news-trea-turner-kyle-schwarber-all-star-standings-analysis/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">recap</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/mlb/philadelphia-phillies/wheeler-one-blip-away-from-perfect-game-leads-phillies-to-series-win-over-reds/4227299/">highlights</a>).</p>
<p>The Sixers’ <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/sixers-jazz-box-score-stats-highlights-recap-vj-edgecombe-ace-bailey-justin-edwards-johni-broome-adem-bona/?utm_source=pv-rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pv-site">new rookie VJ Edgecombe dropped 28 points</a> and a double-double in Summer League action—yes, it’s only July, but hope springs eternal.</p>

<h4>Crash Course</h4>
<p>Center City had a busy stretch of collisions involving police: one <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/sheriffs-office-deputy-other-driver-hospitalized-after-center-city-crash/4227317/">sheriff’s deputy and another driver were both hospitalized</a>, and <a href="https://6abc.com/post/center-city-crash-involving-police-vehicle-leaves-3-injured/16986186/">three more people were hurt</a> in an unmarked police car crash—minor injuries reported.</p>

<h4>Worth Noting</h4>
<ul>
<li>Heat wave on deck means keep an eye out for <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-heat-air-quality-warnings-explainer/">air quality alerts</a>. Bad air days often land with the summer stickiness.</li>
<li>South Philly’s <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/south-philly-lounge-ordered-to-shutter-after-mass-shooting/4227249/">Real 2 Real Lounge was shuttered</a> after a recent mass shooting.</li>
<li>UPenn scientists turned a <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/upenn-researchers-king-tuts-curse-fungus-cancer-treatment/">toxic fungus linked to 'King Tut’s curse'</a> into a cancer-fighting tool. Not your average science beat.</li>
<li>The Philadelphia Latino Arts & Film Festival <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/latino-arts-film-festival-philadelphia-2025/">wrapped up</a> with a big closing party Sunday.</li>
</ul>
