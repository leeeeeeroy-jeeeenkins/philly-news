<h3>Subject: Eagles add muscle, holidays get weird, new bus lanes</h3>
<p><em>Hey Philly, here's what went down while you were out:</em></p>

<h3>🚨 Big Moves in City Hall & Streets</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Red bus-only lanes are coming to Center City and South Philly.</strong> If you drive on Chestnut, 20th, or Snyder, heads up: dedicated red paint for SEPTA buses, less lane to weave between (and probably a few more tickets if you risk it). <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/red-bus-only-lanes-center-city-south-philly/">Details here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Every neighborhood gets a deep clean by February.</strong> The city’s next round of block-and-sidewalk scrubbing is underway. Schedule varies, but relief is in sight for those trash-pocalypse corners. <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/philly-citywide-cleanup-neighborhood-schedule-2025-2026/">Here’s when your block is up</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Bridge repairs close key Aramingo Ave. ramp to I-95.</strong> If you use the Bridge St Interchange, plan an alt route this week. <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/bridge-repairs-close-aramingo-ave-ramp-to-i-95-at-bridge-st-interchange/4295937/">Hit the detour info</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🍴 Food & Survival News</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SNAP benefits in limbo, Philly sets up emergency food relief.</strong> Partial federal funding is coming, but payouts for November could take weeks, leaving thousands food-insecure. The city and nonprofits are stepping up with extra food pantry pop-ups and a <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/pennsylvania-launches-emergency-food-relief-plan-amid-snap-benefits-halt-shutdown">state emergency plan</a>. Need help or want to help? <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/here-are-resources-available-amid-surging-demand-at-local-food-banks/4296223/">Here are resources</a> and <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/free-food-philly-snap-shutdown/">free food spots</a> popping up around the city.</li>
  <li><strong>Philly restaurants under attack by fake 1-star reviews.</strong> Several local spots are getting hammered by bogus online attacks. Owners are scrambling to get platforms to pay attention. <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/philly-restaurants-fake-1-star-reviews-online/4296506/">More on the issue</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🎄 Holiday Traditions on Pause</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wanamaker Light Show and Dickens Village are taking a two-year break.</strong> After this season, both beloved events go dark until 2027 for renovations at the historic building. Go this year or wait it out. <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/wanamaker-light-show-dickens-village-2025-schedule/">Full story</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>⚡ Sports Moves</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Eagles trade for Jaelan Phillips from the Dolphins.</strong> The Birds landed a young edge rusher in exchange for a third-round pick, and Phillips says he’s ready to bring energy. <a href="https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/eagles-news/eagles-trade-for-dolphins-jaelan-phillips-nfl/550394/">What you can expect</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Sixers stay hot, Maxey wins Player of the Week, McCain's debut soon.</strong> Sixers are off to a 5-1 start. Tyrese Maxey picked up some NBA hardware, Kelly Oubre and the rest lit up the Nets, and rookie Jared McCain is probable for his first game Tuesday. <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/sixers-news-analysis-tyrese-maxey-stats-highlights-nba-rumors-awards-eastern-conference-player-of-the-week/">Catch up on Sixers news</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🌕 Looking Up</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Biggest, brightest full moon of the year is Wednesday night.</strong> Might want to take a walk, but maybe skip the Schuylkill since high tides could mean minor flooding in low spots. <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/supermoon-biggest-brightest-2025-flooding/">More on the supermoon</a>.</li>
</ul>
